# Cypress E2E Test Results

## Summary
The Cypress end-to-end tests were executed against the local development server. As expected, some tests failed because certain UI elements are not yet implemented in the application.

## Test Results by Feature

### Authentication
- **Login Page**: Tests for navigation between different portals failed because the expected UI elements are not fully implemented.
- **Registration Page**: Form validation tests failed due to missing form elements.
- **Reset Password**: Some tests passed, including navigation tests, but form validation tests failed.

### User Dashboards
- **Student Dashboard**: Tests failed because the dashboard components are not fully implemented.
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Tests failed because the dashboard components are not fully implemented.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Tests failed because the dashboard components are not fully implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Update the Cypress tests to match the actual implementation of the UI
2. Implement missing UI components to make tests pass
3. Add more specific selectors to target existing elements
4. Consider using data-testid attributes consistently across the application

## Screenshots
Screenshots of failed tests are available in the `cypress/screenshots` directory.
